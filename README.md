# Drug-Classification-ML-research

<h1>Introduction</h1>

The drug classification research project was part of my university course - Information Systems and Big Data and it was performed by me and two other university colleagues. 

The dataset used in this research was taken from the online Kaggle platform https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification.

The dataset contains collected data from a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of five medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.

For every patient we store their age, sex, blood pressure (BP), cholesterol level, sodium to potassium ratio and the type of drug they responded to which is also our target.

The task is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.

<h1>Research structure</h1>
Using Jupyter Notebook, I created a document which then I divided into two parts, each with its own purpose:

1. Dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.

2. Building various ML models that can predict drug type.

The actual scientific paper is written in Macedonian and it is uploaded as a pdf file.
